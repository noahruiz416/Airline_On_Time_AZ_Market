# Airline_On_Time_AZ_Market
In depth regression analysis, leveraging cloud technology and machine learning to predict flight arrival delay times. (Work In Progress)

## Summary:

Every month thousands of airline flights are cancelled, rescheduled, or delayed, leading to negative sentiment from consumers, potential losses from cancelled flights and in the worse cases a chain reaction of delayed flights across multiple airports. For a consumer this leads to a negative customer experience and for the airlines themselves, can cause a decrease in customer & brand loyalty.

This poses the question, what can airlines do to predict flight arrival delays? And from there how can airlines use statistical models and data analytics to mitigate potential loss from large delay times.

There are several common factors used to predict airline flight delays. ‘National Air Security Delay’, ‘Carrier Delay’, ‘Weather Delay’, ‘Late Aircraft Delay’ and ‘Security Delay’ tend to be the most prevalent and will be used throughout the following report to predict arrival delays. Alongside these five common factors several other continuous variables will be analyzed to find any potential alternatives to predict arrival delays.

In this project, I will develop a machine learning model to accurately predict "Airline Arrival Delays". The potential applications of the model are vast and can be used on an ad-hoc basis to predict arrival delays, given a departure delay. In the report below a in depth discussion of the methods, data, regression techniques and more will follow, ending with recommendations and next steps.

## Data:

In order to begin this project and create an accurate machine learning model, data was collected from over 33 years. However due to processing constraints and large changes in the airline industry, since 9/11/2002, we restrict our data from 2003 - 2020. Additionally due to a combination of budget and storage constraints, we further constrain the project to flights only originating in Arizona. Specifically the two largest ariports in the state, 'Tuscon Internation Airport' and 'Phoenix Skyharbor Airport'. From here we also narrow our search to flights with "Arrival Delay" greater than 0 minutes. Meaning that there was delay in the given flights arrival. Several factors that may be able to predict arrival delays include National Air Security Delay’, ‘Carrier Delay’, ‘Weather Delay’, ‘Late Aircraft Delay’ and ‘Security Delay’. Additionally, several other factors were tested for predicting arrival delays including ‘Distance’ and ‘Departure Delays’. All 7 of these factors have the potential to predict arrival delays so, various Exploratory Data Analysis techniques and correlation tests were used to find the optimal values to train the model. The data itself was acquired through IBM, who had an aggregated file of about 87 gigabytes, containing airline data from the BTS. In the next section I discuss the cloud tools utilized in the project, in order to harness the large amount of data given.

## Methods:
Various statical methods and machine learning techniques are used through this report to solve the proposed research question. Extensive exploratory data analysis was conducted prior to the use of machine learning modeling, which is covered in depth in the following section. Multivariable regression was the main algorithm used in this report and multiple models were iterated through to find the best fit model. Libraries used include pandas, seaborn and sklearn, for data cleaning, data visualization and model training. Variance inflation factors were used to test for multicollinearity between independent variables. Train / test splits were also used throughout the report, with the purpose of testing our model’s performance. Finally various metric scores were put together to test the performance of our models. Metrics used include root mean squared error, coefficient of determination and more. Interaction terms were also used in various models to tweak performance.

## Exploratory Data Analysis:
Before running any regression model’s extensive exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain knowledge on the shape, distribution, skew, and any possible correlations between variables. First each delay factor was plotted as a probability distribution, with each of the delay factors being highly skewed to the right. This can be interpreted as each of the delay factors having a relatively low amount of actual delay time in minutes, with the occasional flight that may be delayed for an extensive period. In terms of delay times, these results are in favor for the airlines, as we learn that most flights that are delayed are not for extensive or long time periods. 

After learning about the distribution of airline delay times, scatterplots were used to find any relationship between the delay variables and arrival delay. The scatterplots used are very important as they give an initial idea of relationships between arrival delay and the delay variables. Out of all the variables “departure delay” had the strongest positive linear relationship with arrival delay. “Late Aircraft Delay” and “Carrier Delay” also shared a moderate positive linear relationship with arrival delay though both variables had high amounts of variation, the shorter “Late Aircraft Delay” or “Carrier Delay” was. The remaining delay variables had very little correlation with arrival delay and showed very little signs of any relationship. Finally, boxplots were used to gain an understanding of the number of outliers in each of the delay variables, with each of the delay variables having a high number of outliers. In particular “Late Aircraft Delay” and “Weather Delay” tended to have the highest number of outliers between the delay variables.
